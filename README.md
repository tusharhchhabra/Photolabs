# react-photolabs
Welcome to Photolabs! This website was made as part of my Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs.

# Photolabs
Photolabs is a minimalist photography website where you can see photos shared by some really cool photographers. The website loads all photos at first, and from there you can drill down by category.
